Mythic Upgrades Changelog
This document summarizes changes from the "Mythic Upgrades" script files you provide.
May 15, 2025 - armor_attribute_buff.zs
This script configures and enhances various armor sets from the mythicupgrades mod using CraftTweaker.
Key Changes:
1. Tagging:
   * All mythicupgrades armor pieces (Topaz, Ruby, Peridot, Jade, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Ametrine helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots) are systematically tagged.
   * Tags include:
      * Common type-specific tags (e.g., c:helmets, bookshelf:helmets).
      * General armor tags (e.g., bookshelf:armor, c:armors).
      * advancednetherite compatibility tags for pacification effects against Phantoms, Endermen, and Piglins.
2. Attribute Modifications & Durability:
   * Each armor piece receives global attribute modifiers for generic.armor and generic.armor_toughness.
   * Maximum durability (maxDamage) is set relative to advancednetherite:netherite_diamond_ equivalents.
Specific Set Bonuses:
   * Topaz Armor Set:
      * Helmet: +6 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 3x Durability.
      * Chestplate: +10 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 3x Durability.
      * Leggings: +8 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 3x Durability.
      * Boots: +6 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 3x Durability.
   * Ruby, Peridot, Jade, Aquamarine, Sapphire, and Ametrine Armor Sets (all share the following stats the same as Diamond Netherite):
      * Helmet: +5 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 2x Durability.
      * Chestplate: +9 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 2x Durability.
      * Leggings: +7 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 2x Durability.
      * Boots: +5 Armor, +4 Armor Toughness, 2x Durability.
The UUIDs used for attribute modifiers are consistent for each armor slot across different gem types (except for the unique stats of Topaz).
May 15, 2025 - armor_crafting.zs
This script modifies the smithing recipes for all armor pieces from the mythicupgrades mod using CraftTweaker.

2. New Smithing Recipes Added (minecraft:smithing_transform):
   * New recipes are added to craft each of the mythicupgrades armor pieces.
   * General Recipe Structure for each armor piece (e.g., Topaz Helmet):
      * Base: advancednetherite:netherite_diamond_helmet (or corresponding chestplate, leggings, boots)
      * Addition: mythicupgrades:topaz_ingot (or corresponding gem ingot: Ruby, Peridot, Jade, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Ametrine)
      * Template: mythicupgrades:topaz_upgrade_smithing_template (or corresponding gem upgrade smithing template)
      * Result: mythicupgrades:topaz_helmet (or corresponding gem armor piece)
   * This structure is applied consistently for all helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots across all seven gem types (Topaz, Ruby, Peridot, Jade, Aquamarine, Sapphire, Ametrine).
